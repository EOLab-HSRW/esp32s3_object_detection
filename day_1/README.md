# Image Classification with EDGE IMPULSE (Duckie, cherry or tomato? )
In day one we will assemble our material and run a small test on the microcontroller. Afterwards, you will start gathering a dataset of Duckies, cherries and tomatoes and then we will go to edge impulse to create am image classifier and deploy it in your microcontroller.


## Setup
- Create an account in Edge Impulse: https://edgeimpulse.com
- Create a new personal project
- Clone the CIFAR Dataset repository: https://github.com/YoongiKim/CIFAR-10-images/
- Add Existing Data (Select two classes to start with)
    - Creating Windows...
    - Creating Embeddings
